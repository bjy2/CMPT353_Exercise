1. Based on the results, daily temperatures are not a good way to predict population density. Look at the plot it shows no specific correlation between them.
   Most points are distributed between 10-30 degrees. However, even within this range, there is no obvious increase or decrease in population density caused by temperature increase or decrease.
   Cities with significantly higher population density are irregularly distributed within the range.
   In general, it is not a good way for prediction.

2. The compressed file (.gz) on disk is much smaller than the uncompressed JSON file, which helps reduce disk input/output costs.
   JSON file format contains a lot of repeated structures, such as {"station": "Vancouver"}... Using gzip compression can significantly reduce the file size, instead of keep them all in memory to load.
   With a smaller file size, reading the file using streaming (line-by-line processing) instead of loading the entire file into memory results in faster execution and lower memory usage.
