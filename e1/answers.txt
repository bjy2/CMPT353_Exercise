1. Panda is easier to work with, because compared to numpy, panda has more built-in function for data analysis, such as groupby and aggregate,
    don't need to manually write out many loop to achieve the same result.
    Panda is easier to read as well since many functions are really intuitive and easy to understand, make the whole chunk of code much shorter and easier to read.
    Meanwhile numpy require lot more work to understand.
2. pivot_months_pandas() costs: 5 ms ± 33.4 μs per loop;  pivot_months_loops() costs: 99.1 ms ± 536 μs per loop
    I think pivot_months_loops() is slower than pivot_months_pandas() because the operations like grouping, aggregating and pivoting are more efficient using the 
    function of panda compared to looping operations to collect data using pivot_months_loops().
