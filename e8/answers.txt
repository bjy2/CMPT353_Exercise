1. Bayesian classifier:    0.536 0.611
kNN classifier:         0.726 0.732
Rand forest classifier: 0.714 0.739

KNN did the best overall according to the result. Given the default parameter, kNN did slightly better than Rand Forest and much better than bayesian.

I think that the attribute of KNN does not assume a particular data distribution helps because colour features may not follow a Gaussian distribution.

In LAB colour, distances make sense, meanwhile kNN is sensitive to its neighbours, so kNN is suitable for LAB, this make sense I used LAB colour for my task and kNN did the best;
HSV has an axis “hue” and strong separability, Random Forest takes advantage of this through multiple decision trees, better handle complex boundaries between colors;
RGB measures three primary colours red, green and blue, add together and produce different colour. Rand Forest works well on it.


2. Yes, I believe the mistake is reasonable. Each time I execute gives a different model score, and many cities have quite similar weather data and can lead to mistake for prediction.
To resolve the problem, we can add more data to the dataset like Sunlight hours per month, Wind speed & direction, Humidity levels and so on.
